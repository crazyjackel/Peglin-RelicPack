# Peglin-RelicPack
A Collection of Peglin Relics created with Relic Lib. Meant to be a sample for creating custom relics.

## Details on Each Relic:

- Azidoazide Azide: Increases Bomb Damage and Randomly Sets off Bombs
- Golden Bracelet: Makes Everything Golden. Each Golden Relic increases the damage of each Golden Peg by +1.
- Infected Peglin Head: Extra Life. Gives you Immune after taking fatal damage and healing you.
- Ruby Heart: A Relic Made up of two halves. Max Health Boost and reduces damage taken by a fixed amount.
- Stop Light: Damage Multiplier combined with a new PegType that destroys your balls.
